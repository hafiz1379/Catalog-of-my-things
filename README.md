## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Catalog of my things is console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files.
Created using Ruby!

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
   Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:

```

cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory

```

Clone the project using one of the options.
Using HTTPS:

```
 git clone https://github.com/hafiz1379/Catalog-of-my-things.git

```

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the Catalog of My Things repository.

3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies (in this case, we assume there are no external dependencies, so this step may not be needed):

```
bundle install
```

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Once the setup is complete, ensure you are still in the directory containing the Catalog of My Things files.

2. To run the app, execute the following command:

```
ruby main.rb
```

3.If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.

### Tests <a name="tests"></a>

To run the tests ensure you are in the directory containing the test files.

1. Install RSpec:

Once you have Ruby installed, you can use RubyGems (Ruby's package manager) to install RSpec. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
gem install rspec
```

2. Run the tests using the following command:

```
rspec
```

3. All tests should pass without any errors or failures, ensuring that the code and its methods are functioning correctly.
